                <p>Please note that the record copying process takes approximately 24 working days from start to
                    finish.</p>

                <p>Once you have given us the details of the records that you would like to copy, we will carry out a
                    page check to determine whether we can process your order. The page check costs Â£10, to cover the
                    cost of the service, and is non-refundable.</p>

                <p>If the page check is successful, we will email you with a full breakdown of the further cost of
                    copying the record, which will depend upon the number of pages.</p>

                <p>If you choose to go ahead with you order we can send you a copy digitally via email or we can post a
                    hard copy to you.</p>
