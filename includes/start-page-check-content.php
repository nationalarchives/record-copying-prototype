                <p>Please note that the record copying process takes approximately 20 working days from start to finish.
                    This is due to the high volume of requests that we receive each day.</p>

                <p>Once you have given us the details of the records that you would like to copy, we will carry out a
                    page check to determine whether we can process your order. To carry out a page check, a member of
                    staff will read your request, and collect the records you would like copied from our repositories.
                    They will then manually check the pages of the record and assess whether we will be able to make a
                    copy, based on the information that you have provided us with. The page check costs Â£10, to cover
                    the cost of this service, and is non-refundable. This cost is set by the Treasury.</p>

                <p>If the page check shows that we can make a copy for you, based on the information you've provided us
                    with, we will email you with a full breakdown of the cost of copying the record. If not, we will
                    email you to explain why we are not able to make a copy. If you choose to go ahead with your order,
                    you can decide whether you would like to receive a digital copy via email, or a hard copy or CD Rom
                    by post.
